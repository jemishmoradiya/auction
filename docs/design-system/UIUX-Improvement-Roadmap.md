# UI/UX Improvement Roadmap: Cinematic Alignment

This document lists the identified UI/UX issues across the application and provides a roadmap for bringing all pages up to the **Cinematic Engine v5** standards established in the broadcast stream.

## 1. Global Inconsistencies
- **Palette**: Many pages still use standard Blue/Red shades instead of the semantic `Electric Cyan` and `Toxic Lemon`.
- **Typography**: Missing the "Esports Jersey" (900 Weight, Negative Tracking) look on headings.
- **Surface Design**: Standard cards need to be replaced with `GlassCard` (backdrop-blur + 5% white bg).

## 2. Page-Specific Audit

### **[Dashboard](src/app/page.tsx)**
- [ ] **Color Shift**: Swap all ` blue-*` and `cyan-*` utilities for `--theme-primary`.
- [ ] **Module Styling**: Replace the gradient cards with consistent glassmorphic panels.
- [ ] **Typography**: Apply "Strategic Command" font styles to the main H1.

### **[Tournament Archive](src/app/tournaments/page.tsx)**
- [ ] **Cinematic Header**: Redesign the "New Tournament" button to match the premium "Gateway" style.
- [ ] **Empty State**: Enhance the "No Operations Found" graphic with pulsing ambient glows.
- [ ] **Card Polish**: Shift standard `TournamentCard` to use the technical metric styles for prize pools.

### **[Player Directory](src/app/players/page.tsx)**
- [ ] **Background Sync**: Deepen the background to Onyx Black (`#05070A`).
- [ ] **Role Tabs**: Redesign tabs to matching the "Data Tab" style used in the broadcast engine.
- [ ] **Search HUD**: Replace the standard input with a technical-styled search bar.

### **[Bidding War Room](src/app/auction/[id]/bid/page.tsx)**
- [ ] **Digital Scramble**: Implement the bid amount transition effect.
- [ ] **Tactical UI**: Rebuild the bidding counter to look like a hardware HUD.
- [ ] **Identity Card**: Polish the "Team Identity" header to use the same neon accents as the broadcast stream.

### **[Host Console](src/app/auction/[id]/host/page.tsx)**
- [ ] **Control Center Aesthetic**: Move away from the "Admin Panel" look. Use high-contrast status badges.
- [ ] **Command Buttons**: Stylize the Sold/Unsold/Next buttons to look like physical toggles or "Launch" buttons.
- [ ] **Queue HUD**: Apply the technical list styling (Technical HUD Labels) to the "Up Next" list.
